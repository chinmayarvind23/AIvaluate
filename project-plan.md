- Usage Scenario

## Scope
The goal of this project is to produce a viable, robust, and user-friendly software solution capable of efficiently and effectively grading students HTML, CSS, and JavaScript documents. This will be done using a set of instructions provided by the professor where in return, insightful and accurate grading (relative to human grading) feedback will be provided to both the student and the instructor allowing both users to engage with the web app in a dynamic manner, allowing for students to understand problem areas and work on them and instructors to spend less time grading and more time helping students and developing the course to be the best it can be. 

## Deliverables
Over the course of this project, we will be delivering the following: 
- AI-powered web development course platform
- Project Plan (high-level, and will include descriptions of the features of the project, user requirements, functional requirements, usage scenarios, technical requirements, non-functional requirements, system requirements, project goals, Unique Value Proposition, Minimum Viable Product description, Change management plan, Communications plan, Quality Assurance plan, milestone schedule, and the teamwork planning schedule)
- Design plan (lower-level, and will include details about how the system is designed, how components of the system will interact to produce the required outcome in different scenarios as described in the usage scenarios)
- Presentations for the Project Plan, Design Plan, and the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- Final individual project reports (from each team member detailing components they worked on, as well as how their component works with the remaining components of the system and how the system will function as a whole successfully)

### Project purpose and justification i.e. Unique Value Proposition (UVP)
The AI-Powered Web Development Course Platform aims to streamline and automate the grading process of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript web development course assignments based on professor-defined criteria. Our solution will address inefficiencies and inconsistencies of manual grading by leveraging advanced AI techniques such as LLMs (Large Language Models) to provide accurate, detailed, and timely feedback. This will allow for dynamic engagement between students and instructors. Our platform will provide unique value due to its ability to deliver swift and comprehensive evaluations complemented by a user-friendly interface, and therefore, offering a superior, scalable, and customizable solution for students and instructors. By automating the grading process for instructors and providing immediate feedback that students can take action to, the platform will ensure a more valuable, efficient and insightful educational experience for students and instructors.

## Goals
### High-level project description and boundaries
The project goals for the AI-Powered Web Development Course Platform are to automate the grading of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript assignments with high accuracy and consistency, provide detailed and acurate feedback to enhance student learning, and reduce the grading workload for instructors. Additionally, the platform aims to ensure a user-friendly experience, support scalability for large classes, and to maintain instrustors' previous rubrics and grading criteria to make the resuse of assignments easy.

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Description
- Automated grading engine for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript assignments.
- Interface for instructors to define and save grading criteria and rubrics.
- Submission system for students to upload their code.
- Detailed feedback reports for students based on the automated grading.
- User-friendly interface for both students and instructors.
- Scalability to handle large numbers of students.

## Change management/Communications/QA plan
### Change Management

  - **Justification:** MongoDB is a NoSQL database that provides flexibility with its schema-less design, allowing for easy adaptation to changing requirements. It is well-suited for applications that handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. MongoDB's horizontal scalability makes it ideal for applications expecting rapid growth in user base and data volume.

**API:**
- **OpenAI Assistants API:** We plan to use the Assistants API provided by OpenAI for AI-powered features such as automated grading.
  - **Justification:** The Assistants API offers advanced natural language processing and code interpretation capabilities, which are essential for implementing sophisticated grading algorithms. By leveraging prompt engineering, we can customize the AI responses to provide detailed and context-specific feedback on student submissions. Additionally, the API can handle various file types, allowing us to seamlessly process and grade assignments submitted in different formats. According to the API documentation, .js, .css and .html files are all on their supported list.

**File Storage and Management:**
- **Digital Ocean Space:** For secure file storage.
  - **Justification:** Digital Ocean Space provides scalable and reliable storage for user-uploaded files, with built-in security features such as server-side encryption and access control.

**Testing Frameworks:**

  - **Justification:** Jest is a comprehensive testing framework that provides a simple API for writing tests, along with powerful features such as snapshot testing and parallel test execution, ensuring the reliability and robustness of the codebase.
- **SuperTest:** For integration testing of components in the frontend and backend as well as Database connections
   - **Justification:** SuperTest is a testing framework that is great for integration testing of features as and when new features are written, to ensure the reliability and robustness of the codebase.
- **DalekJS:** DalekJS is a regression testing framework based on JSON, that can ensure that the software is operational after changes have been made
   - **Justification:** DalekJS is JSON-based and will be easy to use as most web and JavaScript have great support for JSON-based frameworks.
- **Mocha:** For testing back-end logic in Node.js.
  - **Justification:** Mocha is a flexible testing framework for Node.js, it provides a robust environment for writing and running unit and integration tests for server-side code. This ensures the back-end logic works correctly under various scenarios, contributing to the overall stability and reliability of the application.

## Teamwork Planning and Anticipated Hurdles (Completion Plan)
For **experience** provide a description of a previous project that would be similar to the technical difficulty of this project’s proposal.  None, if nothing
For **good At**, list of skills relevant to the project that you think you are good at and can contribute to the project. These could be soft skills, such as communication, planning, project management, and presentation.  Consider different aspects: design, coding, testing, and documentation. It is not just about the code.

Rationale for assignment of work among team members:
Our decision to split team members up was based on everyones skills and preferences. Some of our team members felt more comfortable putting a stronger focus on front-end design while others wanted to focus on developing the back-end of the system. We want everyone to be equally involved in each development stage of this proejct so we workign on alot of these features as a team so make sure everyone has a say in whats going on.

## Documentation
This project will be documented using a shared Google Doc. This Document will keep track of our progress, implementions, and the problems we ran into along with their solutions.
